# Boogle Maps

This is a Mock that simulates a Maps WebService where, given a latitude
longitude, will return a random address.

## Instructions

The service is available by default on port `9191`. You can check it on the 
command line by using

```
$ curl http://localhost:9191/maps\?lat\=20.0\&lon\=30.0
```
